# Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition) Notes

As I've been trying to learn about Bayesian statistics, I recently picked up Richard McElreath's Statistical Learning. While I haven't gotten very far into it yet, it's been a joy to read and think about not only Bayesian statistics, but also statistical modeling in general.

Since I want to start doing more things in Python, I figured this repo can serve two purposes:
* Contain notes/answers to end of chapter exercises.
* Have Jupyter notebooks that contain PyMC code (the book is written in R).
